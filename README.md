A basic tutorial for AngularJS Beginners

### Introduction
AngularJS is a complete JavaScript framework for creating dynamic and interactive single-page applications in HTML. This tutorial is designed to cover the basic concepts of the framework using examples. All examples are easy to follow and we'll see how 2-way data binding makes it easy to build pages and forms while maintaining simplicity in the JavaScript code, and come to understand the essential abstractions of AngularJS, including modules, controllers, services & directives. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to start building your own single-page webapps using AngularJS.

### Your must know the following before you start
1. HTML & CSS (using **sass** here.)
2. Basic JavaScript.
3. Chrome Develop Tools
4. A nice code editor (I'm use Sublime Text.)
